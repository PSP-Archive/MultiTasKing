This PRX is required next to the EBOOT.PBP in order to have kernel functions (EBOOT.PBP loading... etc)
Even with chickHEN or stuff that has trouble with kernel, it is required to have "syslib.prx", MultiTasKing will disable kernel mode if required.

The author of "syslib.prx" is Deviante, contact him at www.gcrew.es to know its license and sourcecode (if released).
